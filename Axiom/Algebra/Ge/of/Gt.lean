**Lemma:** If `x` is strictly greater than `y` in a preorder, then `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.
This lemma establishes that a strict inequality (`x > y`) implies the corresponding non-strict inequality (`x ≥ y`) within the context of a preorder. 
It leverages the foundational property `Le.of.Lt` to convert between strict and non-strict inequalities, which is essential in ordered algebraic structures.
