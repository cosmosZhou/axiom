Given `x > 0` and `a < b`, this lemma proves that `x * a < x * b` by leveraging the strict monotonicity of multiplication by positive elements, as defined by the `PosMulStrictMono` typeclass.
It ensures that multiplying both sides of a strict inequality by a positive element preserves the inequality direction.
