This lemma establishes the algebraic identity for the difference of cubes, demonstrating that \( x^3 - y^3 \) factors into \( (x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2) \). 
Verified within the context of a field \( \alpha \), it confirms the validity of this factorization across various mathematical structures where field operations are defined.
