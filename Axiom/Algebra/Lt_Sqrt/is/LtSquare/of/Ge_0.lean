This lemma establishes an equivalence between two inequalities involving a non-negative real number `x` and a real number `y`.
Specifically, it states that for `x ≥ 0`, the inequality `x < √y` holds if and only if `x² < y`.
This equivalence is fundamental in algebraic manipulations where converting between square roots and squared terms is necessary, ensuring validity under the non-negativity condition of `x`.
