-- proof
  -- Split the proof into cases based on the truth value of p
  split_ifs with h_p
  have h := h h_p
  ·
    -- Case 1: p is true
    -- Apply the hypothesis h to get x = a
    subst h
    -- Both sides now simplify to f a, which is equal by reflexivity

  ·
  -- Case 2: p is false
  -- Both sides simplify to b, which is equal by reflexivity
