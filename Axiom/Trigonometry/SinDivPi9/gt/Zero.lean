This lemma establishes that the sine of π/9 is positive by leveraging the angle's position within the first quadrant (0, π/2), where the sine function is known to be positive.
The proof utilizes basic inequalities involving π and applies the general property of the sine function's positivity in the first and second quadrants.

-- proof
  -- Use the fact that π/9 is in the first quadrant (0, π/2) where sine is positive.
  have h : 0 < π / 9 := by linarith [Real.pi_pos]
  -- Use the fact that π/9 is less than π/2, ensuring it remains in the first quadrant.
  have h' : π / 9 < π := by linarith [Real.pi_pos]
  -- Apply the property that sine is positive in the first quadrant.
