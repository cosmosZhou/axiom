This lemma establishes that the sine of π divided by 9 is less than 1/2. 
The proof leverages the inequality sin(x) < x for all positive x less than π/2, applying it to x = π/9. 
By combining this with the previously established fact that π/9 < 1/2, the transitivity of inequalities yields the desired result.
