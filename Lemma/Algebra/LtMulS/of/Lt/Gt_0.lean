Given elements `a`, `b`, and `x` in a preordered algebraic structure with strictly monotonic multiplication by positive elements, if `a` is less than `b` and `x` is positive, then multiplying both sides of the inequality by `x` preserves the strict inequality.
This lemma is a direct application of the `mul_lt_mul_of_pos_right` property, leveraging the `MulPosStrictMono` class to ensure the multiplication respects the order.
