/--
This lemma asserts the associativity of the multiplication operation in a semigroup, confirming that the grouping of elements in a product does not affect the result.
Specifically, it states that for any elements `a`, `b`, and `c` in a semigroup, the product `a * b * c` is equal to `a * (b * c)`, leveraging the inherent associative property of the semigroup's binary operation.
