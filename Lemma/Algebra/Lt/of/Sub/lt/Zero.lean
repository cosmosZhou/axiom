/--
This lemma states that in an ordered additive commutative group, if the difference between two elements `x` and `y` is less than zero (i.e., `x - y < 0`), then `x` is strictly less than `y`.
The proof utilizes properties of ordered groups and algebraic manipulation to derive the inequality directly from the given hypothesis.
