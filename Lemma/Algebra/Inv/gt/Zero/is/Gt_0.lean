This lemma establishes that in a group with zero `α` equipped with a partial order and satisfying `ZeroLEOneClass` and `PosMulReflectLT`, the inverse of an element `x` is positive if and only if `x` itself is positive.
It serves as a simplification rule to handle inequalities involving inverses in ordered algebraic structures.
