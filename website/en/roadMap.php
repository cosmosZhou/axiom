	<h1>Road Map of axiom.top</h1>
	<p>
		The ultimate ideal of axiom.top is Mathematics Mechanization which is
		also the goal of the Chinese institute: <a href="http://www.mmrc.iss.ac.cn/">
			Key Laboratory of Mathematics Mechanization, CAS</a>. So far, its
		research result is not open to general public. As of this writing, in
		world wide, Mathematics Mechanization is still a challenging problem.
		The final goal of sagemath.tech is to develop fully-mechanized
		axiomatized mathematical analysis system, which is open to the general
		public. So far, it has collected roughly 800 mathematical theorems,
		which are proved by this semi-mechanized mathematical proving system.
		The ultimate goal will be realized through the following phases:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>(1) development of rule-bases semi-mechanized axiomatized
			reasoning system which is done so far, but there are known bugs and
			unknown bugs which needs to be overcome;</li>
		<li>(2) collection of over 100,000 mathematical theorems which can be
			proved by semi-mechanized reasoning system, which is a time-consuming
			task, roughly taking 5-10 years effort to finish;</li>
		<li>(3) develop a supervised deep-learning / neural-network model
			which can capture the features of mathematical proving process, and
			train this model on the basis of data collected in previous step;</li>
		<li>(4) devise a semi-supervised / unsupervised model which is able to
			detect unknown theorems that can be proved by applying the existing
			known theorems, and try to prove with a brute-force method.</li>
		<li>(5) the complete mastery of abstract mathematical language in
			computer programming language can be achieved on basis of previous
			step.</li>
	</ul>
