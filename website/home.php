	<h1>What is axiom.top?</h1>
	<p>
		<a href="../axiom"> axiom.top</a> is a website for symbolic
		semi-mechanized axiomatized theorem-proving system, based on
		open-source symbolic computation project of sympy and <a
			href="http://maxima.sourceforge.net"> Maxima </a> , as well as on
		commercial algebraic system <a
			href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/index.html.en?source=footer">
			Mathematica</a>.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		In 2008, the writer embarked on the development of this axiomatized
		mathematical analysis system. The project is being developed mainly in
		the writer's spare time. At that time, the writer of this tool was
		still an undergraduate student. It was originally written in C++,
		based on a deutch project <a href="https://www.ginac.de/"> ginac</a>
		which is a C++ library for symbolic mathematical calculations. The
		axiom proving system was build on top of it.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		In 2016, the writer discovered another open-source symbolic
		computation project, namely <a
			href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html"> sympy</a>, and another
		C++ project <a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine.git">
			symengine</a> which is subset of sympy, as well as <a
			href="http://maxima.sourceforge.net"> Maxima </a> which is a
		Common-Lisp project, and also an open-source integrated tool: <a
			href="https://www.sagemath.org/"> sagemath</a> which is combined tool
		of Maxima, <a href="https://www.maplesoft.com/products/Maple/"> Maple</a>,
		Mathematica, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">
			Matlab</a>, and sympy. As Python is an more efficient language in
		developing (but not in executing) than C++, and a more popular /
		universal language than Common-Lisp, the writer mainly focused on
		developing with Python. Since then, this project was rewritten as /
		translated into a Python project.<br>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		In 2018, the writer established a website, namely <a
			href="http://www.sagemath.tech/sympy"> axiom.top</a> for the purpose
		of sharing this axiomatized reasoning system. The writer also hopes
		that with the aid of open-source community, a large data-set can be
		established by volunteer engineers, so that further development of
		advanced analysis tool based on machine-learning methods can become
		possible.
